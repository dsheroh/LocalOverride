# ABSTRACT: Transparently override subs with those in local module versions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use LocalOverride;

  # Load Foo, followed by Local::Foo
  use Foo;

Or

  use LocalOverride ( base_namespace => 'MyApp', local_prefix => 'Custom' );

  # Just load Moose, since it's not in MyApp::*
  use Moose;

  # Load MyApp::Base, followed by MyApp::Custom::Base
  use MyApp::Base

=head1 DESCRIPTION

When this module is loaded and you C<use> or C<require> another module, it
will automatically check for whether any local modules are present which
override code from the module being loaded.  By default, these override
modules are placed in the file system at a location corresponding to
C<Local::[original module name]>, however their code should be within the
same package as the original module:

  In /path/to/libs/Foo.pm:

  package Foo;
  
  sub bar { ... }
  sub baz { ... }


  In /path/to/libs/Local/Foo.pm:

  package Foo;     # Not Local::Foo!
  
  sub bar { ... }  # Replaces the original sub Foo::bar

This is, obviously, a very extreme approach and one which should be used
only after due consideration, as it can create bugs which are very difficult
to debug if not used carefully.

If warnings are enabled, this will generate warnings about any redefined
subroutines.  You will typically want to include

  no warnings 'redefine';

in your override modules to prevent this.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

The following configuration settings can be used to enable/disable loading of
local override modules or customize where they are located.  They can be set
either by including them as parameters to C<use LocalOverride> or by setting
C<$LocalOverride::[option]>.

Note that, because C<use> is processed at compile-time, any changes made using
the latter method must be made within a C<BEGIN> block if they are intended to
affect modules that you C<use>.  This is not necessary for modules you
C<require>, as C<require> is processed within the normal flow of the program.

=head2 base_namespace

B<Default:> ''

Local overrides will only be loaded for modules which fall within the base
namespace.  For example, if C<$base_namespace> is set to 'Foo', then an
override module will be loaded for C<Foo::Bar>, but not for C<Bar> or C<CGI>.

If C<$base_namespace> is set, overrides will be searched for within that
namespace, such as C<Foo::Local::Bar> (I<not> C<Local::Foo::Bar>) in the
previous paragraph's example case.

The default setting, an empty string, will attempt to load local overrides
for I<all> modules.  Setting C<$base_namespace> is recommended in order to
avoid this.

=head2 core_only

B<Default:> 0

If this is set to a true value, then local override processing will be
disabled.

This module can also be disabled with C<no LocalOverride> if you prefer to
unload it more completely.

=head2 local_prefix

B<Default:> 'Local'

The local prefix defines the namespace (within C<$base_namespace>) used for
local override definitions.
